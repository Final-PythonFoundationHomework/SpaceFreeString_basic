# Reverse String

Objective: The objective of this program is to reverse a given string and display the reversed string as the output. The program will take a string as input, and will output the reversed version of the string. The program will be implemented in such a way that it can handle strings of any length.

## Problem statement

Given a string, the task is to reverse the string and display the reversed version as the output. The program should handle strings of 5 length and should be able to reverse the string characters in place. The program should be implemented in such a way that it can be easily integrated into other applications that require string reversal functionality. The program should be written in Python and should be compatible with all platforms that support Python.


## Example
```
input: string = "abcde"
output: "edcba"
```
```
input: string = "hello"
output: "olleh"
```
## Notes

- The string will always be of length 5.
